Since there is no backend to store data, i would use Asyncstorage. Also i think the task went well but there were some things i could have done better.
Strings could have been stored in an orbject for better organizational purposes and for multilingual support.
Whilst the app itself is responsive and adapted for multiple screen sizes on ios, more can be done to get an almost exact look across all screen sizes with a little bit of 
tweaking. Lastly, a more robust validation technique could have been used rather than regex. Either way, it was fun working on the project.
